    "text": "While the current scholarly effort of literature review focuses on understanding published works’ vision, content, method, results, limitation, etc., we aim to find meaningful information from research papers’ acknowledgment section. The acknowledgment section appears in most research papers but does not gather much interest as we know. We want to understand the different aspects of the acknowledgment section, how they are organized, and within a specific field, are there frequently mentioned names and entities? In addition, we will discuss how to incorporate these findings to present helpful information to readers when they use search engines looking for related research interests."
